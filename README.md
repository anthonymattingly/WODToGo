May 2017 Front End Code Louisville Project.
This application generates workouts for the user that they can perform using only their own bodyweight.  The user clicks on three buttons and each button generates a movement that forms part of a workout.  Plain JavaScript and JQuery are each used.
THe project is uploaded to a live site at www.worktouttogo.site.  A mobile and desktop site are both created.
An AJAX request from Wunderground.com is used to update the page with location and weather data using geolocation features.  Because of server security issues, this feature MAY NOT DISPLAY IN ALL BROWERS ON THE LIVE SITE but the code loaded to GitHub reflects this property of the project.
All CSS is custom.
